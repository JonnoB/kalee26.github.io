# Using MathJax in github pages

Using mathjax is very useful for rendering equations.
However getting things to work as expected can be challenging

## Latex

Different renderers can been diifferent approaches. 
Does single dollar sign $\left \langle C \right \rangle _{m = i} = \frac{1}{z}\sum_j^z C_j P(C_j \mid m = i)$

Or do you need to use double dollar sign $$\left \langle C \right \rangle _{m = i} = \frac{1}{z}\sum_j^z C_j P(C_j \mid m = i)$$.


If we can render this sucessfully we can continue to create interesting websites using convenient markdown.
